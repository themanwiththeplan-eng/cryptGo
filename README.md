# cryptGo
A user friendly application that allows users to check the current value of crypto currencies, without having to open an internet browser. 
The cryptGo app lets users search cryptocurrency and add favorites to a favorites list, enabling the user to keep track of their main purchasing/research
interests. 

## User Story 

As a USER interested in learning more  about crypto before making a purchase, 
I WANT  to have crypto current values at my  fingertips without having to use Google or a coin purchasing app,
SO THAT I can make decisions about purchasing crypto and expand my knowledge.

GIVEN a crypto dashboard with an input form,
When I type into the input and click search button, 
I am PRESENTED with that crypto currencyâ€™s NAME  and CURRENT USD VALUE.I am also presented with 3 similar cryptos NAMES. TICKERS, AND CURRENT USD VALUES. 
 
When I CLICK THE HEART BUTTON TO FAVORITE  that cryptocurrency , it is SAVED to my FAVORITES LIST and stays displayed on the SideNav  when I refresh or close it. 
When I CLICK ON THE FAVORITE from the sidenav, I am PRESENTED with the the same information as if I had retyped in the coin name again. 

## What We Did 
The cryptGo team built an application with a web responsive polished UI that allows users to search crypto currency and displays real-time data
for that cryptos value in USD. It also allows users to view 3 similar crypto currencies based on their search.The app cryptGo allows users to save the crypto to a 
favorites list to reference at any time , bringing up the real-time value for the crypto,with just a click of a button, INSTEAD of having to search 
again for the crypto and remember which crypto they had searched SEVERAL MINUTES or even DAYS AGO.

## How We Did It 
The crytpGo team used 2 server side API's to fetch the real-time data  displayed to the user. (CoinGecko.com API and Nomics.com API)
Utilizing JavaScript and Jquery to create functions , event listeners and call back functions. 
The cryptGO team also used md bootstrap and CSS Flexbox and custom-styling  to create a mobile-first responsive web design.
