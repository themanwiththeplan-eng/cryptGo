# cryptGo
A user friendly application that allows users to check the current value of crypto currencies, without having to open an internet browser. 
The cryptGo app lets users search cryptocurrency and add favorites to a wacth lists, enabling the user to keep track of their main purchasing
interests, along with top news articles on the cryptocurrency, ALL IN ONE PLACE.

## What We Did 
The cyrptGo team built an application with a web responsive polished UI that allows users to search crypto currency and displays real-time data
for that cryptos value in USD. It also allows users to also have access the most recent headlines about the crypto , and to save the crypto to a 
favorites list to reference at any time , bringing up the real-time value for the crypto,with just a click of a button, INSTEAD of having to search 
again for the cypto.

## How We Did It 
The crytpGo team used 2 server side API's to fetch the real-time data and the news articles displayed to the user. 
Utilizing JavaScript and Jquery to create functions , event listeners and call back functions. 
The cryptGO team also used md bootstrap and CSS Flexbox and custom-styling  to create a mobile-first responisve web design.
